# BURNED — TODO

## NEXT SESSION — pick up here (2026-04-25)

**Playtest-harness Phase 2 SHIPPED (2026-04-24).** All 10 units landed with
runtime verification. Phase 1 is approved + locked. Cadence-compliant
debrief owed at phase boundary.

### Phase 2 state of the world

**Full test suite:** 527/527 green · typecheck clean · ESLint clean
(modulo one pre-existing palette warning) · client-bundle sentinel
regression test active (sabotage-verified)

**New server surfaces:**
- `GET /health` → `{ ok, playtest, version }` in every build (no DO wake)
- `role=god` WS upgrade — HTTP-level auth gate in `fetch()` (401/403
  rejections BEFORE upgrade), LAN/localhost/PLAYTEST_GOD_ORIGINS-only
  origin allowlist, constant-time token compare
- `playtest-config` admin message — queued, first-write-wins latch
- `god-event` WS broadcast — emitted from `broadcastGameState` on
  every successful dispatch; structural equality with concurrent
  player-update by construction
- `ctx.nopeWindowMs` override + seedable mulberry32 RNG both gated
  on `this.playtestSeed`

**New files (all pure, unit-tested):** `playtest.ts`, `health.ts`, `rng.ts`,
`god-connection.ts`, `playtest-config.ts`, `god-projection.ts`.
`room.ts` is thinner: Env interface hoisted; `Server<Env>` parameterized;
onConnect gains god-tagging branch; broadcastGameState gains god-event
emission behind `pendingGodEventTrigger`.

**Benchmarks @ N=10 (hard roster max):** buildGodProjections avg 0.005 ms
· buildGodEventMessage avg 0.002 ms · god-event payload ~19 KiB. All
budgets ~2000× under. Zero headroom concern.

**Smoke test (`pnpm playtest:smoke`):** 7/7 steps green against real
`wrangler dev`. Covers /health, god auth rejection (WS + direct HTTP
probe paths), valid auth accept, playtest-config latch LOCKED rejection.

**Insights captured this session:**
- **022** — partyserver's `cloudflare:` scheme makes `room.ts`
  unimportable in Vitest-Node tests. Net constraint: `room.ts` is a
  thin wiring layer; all testable logic in pure sibling modules.
- **023** — partyserver `connection.close()` inside `onConnect` under
  hibernation does NOT promptly deliver a close frame. WS auth gates
  MUST live in the `fetch()` entry point, not `onConnect`.

### Immediate priorities (ordered)

1. **Phase 2 debrief with Briggsy.** Cadence per 2026-04-24: phase →
   stop → debrief + /distill → next phase. Distill already ran at
   phase boundary (022 + 023). Debrief = review the 10-unit commit stack
   and any Phase 3 scope questions BEFORE executing Phase 3.
2. **Execute Phase 3** — harness infrastructure (orchestrator process,
   god-event reassembly buffer, `events.jsonl` write path). Plan locked
   at `docs/plans/playtest-harness/phase-3-harness-infra.md`. Phase 3
   consumes Phase 2's god-event shape directly — Unit 4 in Phase 3 is
   the reassembly buffer that the Phase 2 split-envelope design
   anticipates (though splitting has not yet fired — payload 19 KiB at
   N=10 is comfortable).
3. **Phases 4 → 5** per locked plans. Phase 6 is the first REAL session
   and requires eye-in-loop verification — STOP before it runs
   autonomously.
4. **IncomingSteal banner real-device verification** (`82af35f9`) — still
   pending from prior sessions. Playwright + unit tests green, phone-side
   pre-resolution screenshot never caught. Earth > map.
5. **Host-identity cluster (P1 deferred).** B-01/B-02/B-11/B-12/B-14 —
   significant infra, design questions first.
6. **Remaining P1/P2 from `docs/testing/E2E-ISSUE-LIST.md`** — cosmetic
   and scope-decision items, pick opportunistically.

### Phase 1 Column divergences — candidates for E2E-ISSUE-LIST.md additions

Still open from Phase 1 drafting. Full text in
`docs/testing/playtest/SCENARIOS.md` §Column divergences. Highlights:

- **Atomicity-gap bug class** (insight 021) — 4 scenarios re-surface the
  pre-A-01 strip-before-validate pattern: Extraction proactive,
  Direct Order eliminated-target, Back-Channel empty-deck, Favor
  self-target. Same dispatch-time-guard repair template as A-01.
- Favor auto-resolve TARGET-silence on empty-hand or Burned-only hand
  (correct engine, weak UX).
- Intel → Back-Channel `pendingFuture` clearing semantics — product call.
- Spectator `namedCardType` visibility — engine correct (closed: see
  Phase 1 plan-doc correction, insight trail).
- Board-drama variant for Burned draw (known: C-15).

### Phase 1 catalog gaps (intentional — documented)

- D-03 simultaneous-Nope UX — no dedicated scenario; Phase 3 orchestrator
  can script on demand if needed.
- B-13 active-player-mid-turn disconnect — adjacent to
  `SCN-CONN-NAME-CARD-PENDING-DISCONNECT-01`; not dedicated.
- Free-play scenarios (4) omit the 7-row info-gap by design.

### IncomingSteal banner — what to check (commit `82af35f9`)

On a real 3-of-a-kind named steal, target's phone shows `// INCOMING LIFT /
{STEALER} / is lifting your / {CARD NAME}` banner DURING the 10s nope window
(not just post-resolution). Countdown ticks, urgent-red flip at ≤2s, banner
exits clean when the window resolves. Verify bystanders see no banner and no
card name anywhere.

## 🛡️ PLAYTEST HARNESS — HARDEN PASS COMPLETE (2026-04-23 overnight)

All 6 phase plans **LOCKED**, PRD v0.2 **LOCKED**, roadmap **active**. Ready
to execute builds when Briggsy greenlights (builds were descoped overnight —
harden-only was the final scope).

**Artifact locations (all LOCKED 2026-04-23 against engine/room @ `e6b31b5c`,
projection @ `5e86f811`):**
- PRD: `docs/testing/PLAYTEST-HARNESS-PRD.md` — v0.2 LOCKED
- Roadmap: `docs/plans/playtest-harness/roadmap.md` — active
- Phase plans: `docs/plans/playtest-harness/phase-{1..6}-*.md` — all `status: locked`
- Coherence audit: `docs/plans/playtest-harness/COHERENCE-SWEEP.md`

**Insights captured:**
- `docs/insights/019-surface-coherence-review-misses-signature-drift.md` —
  surface-level confidence scoring misses code-grounded drift; rigor passes
  need at least one code-grounded reviewer.
- `docs/insights/020-subagent-capability-enforcement-is-frontmatter-not-wrapper.md`
  — TypeScript wrappers can't restrict Claude subagents; enforcement lives at
  `.claude/agents/*.md` frontmatter `tools:` whitelist because MCP tools
  cross process boundaries.

**Next steps:**
- ✅ **Phase 2 SHIPPED 2026-04-24** — 10 units, full suite 527/527, live
  smoke green. See top-of-file §"Phase 2 state of the world" for detail.
- Execute Phase 3 → Phase 5 per locked plans. Phase 6 is the first real
  session; STOP before Phase 6 without eye-in-loop verification.
- Insights 019 + 020 should guide future rigor passes on agent-native plans.
  Insights 022 + 023 (captured during Phase 2) feed into Phase 3 scope
  decisions about how orchestrator code can be tested.

### Sequential-vs-parallel analysis (Briggsy's end-of-session question)

**Premise tested:** Phase N learns from Phase N-1. Answer: **YES, strongly
verified.** Every H-Na absorption inherited a material architectural
correction from the preceding H-(N-1)b rigor pass:

- H-1b → H-2a: god-event emission site moved from dispatch to
  `broadcastGameState`. Phase 3 Unit 4 reassembly architecture depends on
  this. Parallel run would have built Phase 3 on the wrong assumption.
- H-2b → H-3a: `expectedViewerIds` + `/health` added to Phase 2 upstream.
  Phase 4 consumes both. Parallel run would have missed them.
- H-3b → H-4a: `SeatPageWrapper` deleted, custom `.claude/agents/playtest-
  seat.md` pattern introduced, `info-gap-divergence` → `ui-spec-divergence`
  rename. Phase 5's Unit 1b + 4 entryType consumption depends on all three.
  Parallel run would have had to rewrite Phase 5 after the fact.
- H-4b → H-5a: role-drift demoted to LOW-SIGNAL, Column-1 analysis
  scrubber-aware-limited. Phase 6 calibration decisions reference both.
  Parallel run would have missed.
- H-5b had no downstream.

**Counterfactual time estimate:** Pure parallel absorptions + parallel rigor
would save ~2-3h wall time but would require a second pass to propagate
every cross-phase correction surfaced during rigor — effectively converging
back to sequential + coherence-sweep fixes. The "savings" get eaten by
rework churn, and the intermediate state (each phase locked on wrong
upstream) invites partial commits that are hard to unwind.

**Recommendation:** Keep sequential for any plan set where downstream
phases demand contracts from upstream. Parallel is fine for orthogonal
work (different subsystems, no shared contract surface). The premise
held; sequential was the right call.

## Active Priorities

### 1. BURNED CARD CINEMATIC ARC — sub-steps #3 and #4

Sub-steps #1 (drawer card-fill) and #2 (non-drawer/board card-flip) SHIPPED
(see phone-verify table above). #3 and #4 remain.

**Sub-step #3 — DefusePlacement hero card.** Sheet is currently text-only
("Hide the Burned Card" + position buttons). Drawer just dodged death — hero
the Burned card at the top of the sheet during position-pick. Visual continuity
from drama → decision: "this is what you're hiding, where?"

**Sub-step #4 — Regen the Burned card art.** Once #3 lands, the illustration
becomes the visual keystone. Direct Order + Intercepted shipped; Burned is the
only action card still at original Apr-9 quality.

Art concept pitches for #4:
- **A. Operative caught in flashbulb exposure** — bright white/amber flashbulb
  blast from outside frame, operative silhouette caught mid-turn looking
  toward camera, surprise/recognition expression, dark city street or rooftop.
  Pure noir "the moment your cover is blown."
- **B. Photograph emerging from developer tray** — close-up overhead of
  darkroom developer tray, B&W surveillance photo of the operative fully
  developed, red darkroom light overhead. Ties to Intel Briefing's photography
  vocabulary.
- **C. Cinematic upgrade of the current explosion concept** — keep the badge-
  in-flames idea but go full Archer-spec: operative's spy ID card with photo,
  burning at edges against dark void, embers and smoke rising.

**Claude's lean:** A (flashbulb exposure) — most narratively precise for
"Burned" = identity exposed. Tonally different from Direct Order / Intercepted
(both interiors) — exterior/action beat adds variety.

Process per regen:
1. Archive current: `public/assets/cards/_archive/burned-<date>-<reason>.webp`.
2. Tighten prompt in `scripts/generate-cards.ts` — minimum-viable wins.
3. `set -a && source .env && set +a && npx tsx scripts/generate-cards.ts --only=burned`.
4. Critically eyeball the temp PNG — state flaws, don't narrate hopes.
5. `npx tsx scripts/process-assets.ts` once approved.

### 2. Real-device playtest

Live 4-8 player test on iPad Pro 1366 + phones. Verify:

- Triple-steal deferred commit — cards return on cancel, nope window opens
  AFTER the name.
- Favor-target banner + staging (no sheet modal).
- Discard hero sizing reads from couch distance.
- Burned two-beat drama sequence on non-drawer phones.
- Card-drawn toast fires for drawer only on safe draw.
- `pnpm dev:launch` debugging ergonomics.
- Emil pass on-phone: SmartActionBox `:active` scale lands during breathing;
  card-tap squeeze reads tactile; hand→enlarge blur doesn't stutter on Safari;
  sheets press feedback doesn't fight overscroll.
- Emil pass on-TV: briefing cascade reads as a coherent arc; idle ticker stays
  ambient once real COMMS accumulate; Lobby disabled sheen subtle; status
  strip crossfade on turn handoff doesn't ghost.
- Emil Phase 3 on-phone: StagingArea enlarge no longer stutters; DefusePlacement
  ± steppers feel tactile at 0.95 press; PendingPromptBanner crossfade on
  defuse → favor-response swap reads as status line.
- Emil Phase 3 on-TV: NopeCountdownBar fade-in; PendingPromptBanner 6px lift
  at couch distance; Lobby startButton hover on desktop, not sticky on hybrid
  touch; GameOver 80ms stagger at 10 players.
- Emil Q verification: Nameplate flip 400ms vs 250ms (crisp brass click vs
  heavy coin flip); perspective 1000px vs 600px (flat fade-swap vs physical
  3D rotation).

### 3. 8-player stress test

Verify PlayerStrip layout at max count on real TV, COMMS scroll under event
volume, nameplate legibility from couch distance. At 1366×1024, strip math
leaves ~34px headroom with all 10 tiles; verify at 1920 and 4K that tiles
grow proportionally.

### 4. Live mid-play state verification — `tests/e2e/arena-states.spec.ts`

Playwright: 3-player game, drive `window.__gameStore` dev hook to force each
state, screenshot each. Target states: Nope window mid-countdown, DramaOverlay
(BURNED → EXTRACTED, ELIMINATED, INTERCEPTED, WINS), Favor banner + staging,
Triple-steal name-card sheet pre-commit and post-name, FuturePeek (read-only
and rearrange). Output to `temp/arena-states/` for eyeball review. ~30 min
per state; ~3-4 hours for the full set.

### 5. Physical hardware verification

Push commits, deploy to Cloudflare Pages (wrangler), open on actual TV with
phone controllers.

### 6. Extend PlayerAlert coverage (optional)

- **Reassign / Direct Order target** — no direct event type; victim only
  learns via `turn-started` with `turnsRemaining > 1`. Probably fine as-is
  because the target's phone sits dormant — when they come back, staging is
  lit and status reads "Your turn · 3 turns".
- **Your card was intercepted** — optimistic snapback + board DramaOverlay
  already communicate this; explicit phone toast would remove ambiguity.
  Skip until playtest reveals confusion.

### 7. Execute CSS Phase 5 — Verification & Acceptance

`/ce:work docs/plans/css-foundation-rebuild/phase-5-verification-acceptance.md`

### 8. Desk redesign follow-ups

- **Color check** — color blindness + reading of manila/cordovan/brass/mahogany
  palette. Needs a color-sighted eye (Harry?) before touching manila-face,
  brass tones, or tab hex. All reds currently unified through
  `--color-accent-burned`.
- **Phase 5.5 assets (skipped)** — ashtray + stubbed cigar, whisky tumbler,
  closed dossier stack. Need Imagen generation to hit quality bar. Candidates:
  upper-left desk (ashtray), opposite corner (tumbler catching venetian-blind
  light), below/beside active dossier (closed stack = "other cases").
- **Status strip height** — `.statusStrip` went 44 → 56px to host plate +
  stand. Verify on real TV that piles/dossier vertical band isn't squeezed.

### 9. Optional polish

- **Brass studs on wood frame.** CSS pseudo-elements (small radial-gradient
  dots at regular intervals on `.woodTop/.woodBottom`).

### 10. Optional test coverage expansion (deferred until visual layer stabilizes)

- **Card-drawn toast E2E** (~30 min). Extend Tier 1 spec: active phone taps
  `End turn · draw`, assert `PlayerAlert` renders `You drew {name}.`.
- **Pixel-diff regression** (~2h setup + ongoing baseline maintenance).
  Playwright `toHaveScreenshot()` with committed baselines. Requires
  `MotionConfig reducedMotion="always"` in test mode + fixed server RNG seed.
  Defer until after CSS Phase 5 lands — mid-rebuild baselines churn too fast.

## Landmines

Landmines no longer live in TODO.md. They found their right homes on
2026-04-23:

- **Hard-won lessons** (problem → root cause → fix → pattern) → `docs/insights/`. See `013-018` for the recent migration batch.
- **Architectural conventions** (protocol, engine invariants, client patterns, motion rules, dev tooling, Imagen workflow) → `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Canonical game rules** → `docs/RULES-REFERENCE.md`.

Nothing hides here anymore. TODO.md is for actionable items only.
