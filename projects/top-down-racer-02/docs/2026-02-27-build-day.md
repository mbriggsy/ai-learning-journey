# Build Day: 2026-02-27

## The Short Version

We built a fully playable top-down racing game with three tracks, a main menu, sound effects, visual effects, an Xbox controller, and a complete physics engine — **in a single day** — using Claude Code + GSD agent orchestration.

## How We Got Here

### Morning: Environment Setup

Before a single line of game code was written, Harry (the OpenClaw wizard) set up the full development stack:

- **Project scaffolded** at `projects/top-down-racer-02/` inside the `ai-learning-journey` repo
- **Stack installed:** TypeScript 5.9 + PixiJS 8.16 + Vite 7.3 + Vitest 4.0 + pnpm
- **Claude Code tooling configured:**
  - GSD (Get Shit Done) orchestration framework → `~/.claude/commands/gsd`
  - Context7 MCP (live library docs)
  - Serena MCP (semantic code navigation)
  - Sequential Thinking MCP
  - Playwright MCP (browser automation)
  - Visual Explainer skill
  - Compound Engineering plugin
  - All MCP servers configured with `cmd /c` wrapper for Windows compatibility
  - Full permissions allowlist — no more approval prompts
  - `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` enabled

## What GSD Built

### Phase 1 — Core Simulation Engine ✅

GSD kicked off `/gsd:new-project`, mapped the codebase, conducted research, and immediately started TDD implementation. **No human wrote any game code.**

| Commit | What landed |
|--------|-------------|
| `8098da6b` | Vec2 math module — 18 pure functions, 53 tests |
| `f6ed80f7` | Catmull-Rom spline with arc-length parameterization |
| `f1bafa66` | Track builder, surface detection, Track 01 layout |
| `2365ad64` | Wall collision detection with sliding response |
| `232a36a4` | Car physics — bicycle model |
| `1fee1f48` | World step function, determinism tests, oversteer |
| `4fe33bf9` | Checkpoint system + lap timing |

**Architecture principle:** The engine (`src/engine/`) is pure TypeScript with zero PixiJS imports. Runs headless for future AI training. Renderer reads engine state — engine never touches pixels.

---

### Phase 2 — PixiJS Renderer ✅

GSD immediately moved to Phase 2 without being asked. Research → plans → implementation.

| Commit | What landed |
|--------|-------------|
| `f85b5b5a` | Vite config, index.html, async entry point |
| `47815d13` | GameState, InputHandler, GameLoop |
| `8ed0c125` | RendererApp with PixiJS init, loading screen, scene graph |
| `5740a442` | CameraController + TrackRenderer |
| `c5aeba3e` | HudRenderer (speed, lap, time, position, minimap) |
| `a9cf51bc` | CarRenderer, WorldRenderer — wired into RendererApp |
| `b12b0da6` | OverlayRenderer (countdown, pause, respawn, lap-complete) |
| `ed10297b` | Physics tuning, camera fixes, Xbox controller, oval track |
| `d011e235` | IndyCar sprite, wider camera, rebalanced HUD and physics |

Physics tuning iterations:
- `c902148a` — Arcade bicycle steering, softer feel, no spin-in-place
- `31375372` — Faster top speed, swept wall collision, larger HUD
- `f5b73837` — Gradual steering at speed, finish line rendering

---

### Phase 3 — Game Features & Polish ✅ (in progress)

| Commit | What landed |
|--------|-------------|
| `9dc06d4f` | RaceController extracted to engine, slip angle to CarState |
| `f3712dcb` | Visual effects, sound system, two new tracks |
| `ddba7017` | Regular enums for esbuild compat, visible skid marks |
| `2ff4b2a8` | Menu system — track select, settings, best times |
| `262b3dda` | Runoff zones, track redesigns, slider release, card overflow fixes |
| `9e122e20` | Animated main menu — full racing launcher redesign |
| `5a2b6bd5` | Sound manager, overlay renderer overhaul, engine + test updates |
| `053963f4` | Shoulder surface type — eliminates false dust particles |

---

## By The Numbers

- **60+ commits** in one day
- **3 phases** completed (engine, renderer, polish)
- **3 playable tracks**
- **Xbox controller** supported
- **Sound effects** system
- **Visual effects** (dust, skid marks, shoulder surface)
- **Full menu system** (track select, settings, best times)
- **Animated main menu**
- **Zero** hand-written game code by humans

## The Stack That Made This Possible

```
Claude Code 2.1.62
└── GSD orchestration (github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done)
    ├── Context7 MCP      → live PixiJS v8 / Vite docs on demand
    ├── Serena MCP        → semantic code navigation across the codebase
    ├── Sequential Thinking MCP → structured multi-step planning
    └── Playwright MCP    → browser automation for visual testing

TypeScript 5.9 + PixiJS 8.16 + Vite 7.3 + Vitest 4.0 + pnpm
```

---

## What's Next

- Phase 4: AI bridge (Python ↔ TypeScript, Gymnasium wrapper, headless training mode)
- Phase 5: RL training pipeline (PPO/SAC via stable-baselines3)
- Phase 6: AI vs Human race mode

The engine was built headless-first for exactly this reason. When Phase 4 lands, the AI trainer will call `world.step()` directly — no renderer, no browser, just pure simulation at maximum speed.

## Lessons

**GSD is a paradigm shift.** racer-01 took weeks of manual iteration — reward tuning, fix agents, version after version — and never got a car to reliably navigate a corner. racer-02 built a complete playable game in a day.

The difference: GSD does research before writing code, plans atomically, tests as it goes, and never loses context between tasks. It's not autocomplete. It's an engineering team.
