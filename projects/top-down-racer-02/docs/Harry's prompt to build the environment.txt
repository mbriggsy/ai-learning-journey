Harry the top-down-racer-v02-setup-guide.docx in the 02 docs folder has everything we need to setup the environment for 02 racer.
Start at Phase B. Run every command in Git Bash. The doc is sequential — don't skip ahead. If something fails, check the troubleshooting table at the end before texting me. When you get to Phase H and everything's green, stop. We'll kick off /gsd:new-project together.
Note: had to correct the path in the word doc, but other than that everything worked!
