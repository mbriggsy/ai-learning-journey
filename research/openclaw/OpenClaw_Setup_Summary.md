# 🦞 OpenClaw Installation & Setup

**Session Date:** February 21, 2026  
**Machine:** Windows (Native — no WSL2)  
**OpenClaw Version:** 2026.2.21-2

---

## Overview

Successfully installed and configured OpenClaw on Windows natively. OpenClaw is an open-source personal AI agent that connects to messaging platforms and performs tasks on your behalf. The agent was named **Harry (a wizard in training)** and connected to Discord.

---

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v24.13.1 (requires v22+) — already installed
- Windows PowerShell — must run as **Administrator** for service installation
- Discord account with Developer Mode enabled

---

## Installation Steps

### Step 1: Install OpenClaw

Run in PowerShell (Admin):

```powershell
iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```

During onboarding wizard:
- Declined zsh shell completion (Windows only — not applicable)
- Chose to install gateway service

### Step 2: Install Gateway Service

First attempt failed because PowerShell wasn't elevated. Re-ran as Administrator:

```powershell
openclaw doctor --fix
```

This installed the gateway as a **Windows Scheduled Task**.

### Step 3: Fix Discord Crash (Error 4014)

Gateway crashed immediately on startup due to Discord bot misconfiguration. Temporarily disabled Discord:

```powershell
openclaw config set channels.discord.enabled false
```

This allowed the gateway to start cleanly while Discord was being properly configured.

### Step 4: Start Gateway Manually

The Windows Scheduled Task failed with *"system cannot find the file specified"*. Workaround — run the gateway script directly:

```powershell
C:\Users\brigg\.openclaw\gateway.cmd
```

> ⚠️ **Note:** This keeps the gateway running only while that PowerShell window is open. The Scheduled Task auto-start issue still needs to be resolved in a future session.

## Discord Bot Setup

1. **Created Discord Application** — https://discord.com/developers/applications → New Application
2. **Enabled Bot Intents** — Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents → Presence, Server Members, Message Content all ON
3. **Set Bot Permissions** — View Channels, Send Messages, Read Message History
4. **Generated OAuth2 URL** — OAuth2 → URL Generator → scopes: bot
5. **Created Discord Server** — "Harry's Lair" — private server for bot interaction
6. **Added Bot Token to OpenClaw:**
   ```powershell
   openclaw channels add --channel discord --token <token>
   ```
7. **Configured Channel Allowlist** — `openclaw configure` → Channels → Discord → Modify Settings → Allowlist → added #general channel ID

## Key Commands Reference

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `openclaw gateway start/status` | Start and check gateway |
| `openclaw doctor --fix` | Run health checks and auto-fix |
| `openclaw configure` | Interactive setup wizard |
| `openclaw channels status --probe` | Check channel health |
| `openclaw dashboard` | Open browser UI at http://127.0.0.1:18789/ |

---

## Current Status

- ✅ OpenClaw v2026.2.21-2 installed on Windows native
- ✅ Gateway running (manual start via gateway.cmd)
- ✅ Browser dashboard working at http://127.0.0.1:18789/
- ✅ Harry the wizard online in Discord (Harry's Lair server)
- ✅ Agent model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6
- ⚠️ Windows Scheduled Task auto-start still failing — needs fix in future session
- ⚠️ Memory search not configured (no embedding provider set)

---

## Next Steps / Future Work

1. Fix Windows Scheduled Task so Harry auto-starts on boot without needing manual gateway.cmd
2. Configure an embedding provider for memory/semantic search (OpenAI or Gemini API key)
3. Explore Harry's skills — web browsing, email, calendar, file management
4. Consider adding Telegram as a second messaging channel
